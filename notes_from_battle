require 'sinatra/base' in app.rb

rackup - run config.ru file - creates server
and the config.ru tells to run Battle.

You may notice the line 'run! if app_file == $0' in app.rb.  run! is a method that runs the program. app_file is the file you are in. And $0 is the command you type in the terminal (if you use rackup, then $0 == rackup, when using ruby app.rb, $0 will equal the app itself (app.rb).)

 it essentially saying run this file when app_file equals the command you type in the terminal. So when you type 'ruby app.rb' - it will run.

 However, if you have a config.ru file, and run 'rackup', you will notice that the file still runs. This is because this whole line is only needed if you are starting up your server using 'ruby app.rb'.

 tl;dr - you don't need this line if you have a working config.ru file.
